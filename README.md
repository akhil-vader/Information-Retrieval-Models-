# Information-Retrieval-Models-

Objective:
Implement and compare various retrieval systems using vector space models and language models.

This involves writing two programs:
A program to parse the corpus and index it with elasticsearch
A query processor, which runs queries from an input file using a selected retrieval model


# The models implemented
Okapi TF
TF-IDF
Okapi BM25
Unigram LM with Laplace smoothing
Unigram LM with Jelinek-Mercer smoothing
